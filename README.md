# Scribble: Notes App
A new Flutter Application.


## Description

Scribble is a versatile notes application developed using Flutter, designed to empower users to effortlessly capture, organize, and retrieve their ideas. The app is meticulously crafted to assist users in managing their thoughts, appointments, and essential information with efficiency, all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.


## Features

- **Categorized Notes:** Organize your thoughts effectively by creating dedicated notes for each idea. Whether for work, personal matters, or creative projects, you can easily generate multiple notes tailored to your specific needs.
- **Add Notes:** Effortlessly add notes with distinct colors to quickly identify and differentiate them.
- **Edit Notes:** Easily modify the color, title, and content of your notes as necessary.
- **Delete Notes:** Remove notes that are no longer needed with just a few clicks.
- **Dark Mode:** Enjoy a dark-themed interface with integrated dark mode support.


## Technologies Used

- **NoSQL Database (Hive):** Scribble leverages Hive, a NoSQL database, to manage data efficiently. This project marks my initial exploration into NoSQL databases, and Hive has proven to be an outstanding choice, offering seamless integration and efficient data management capabilities.
- **State Management (Cubit):** The Cubit state management pattern has been utilized to ensure a robust and organized approach to managing the application's state. This method has resulted in enhanced code maintainability and an improved user experience.
